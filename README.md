# Go-lang github Actions 

This is just a small script to have a poc of working github actions.

There is a pipeline to build the go lang code and create a docker image, this image is then pushed to the AWS ECR. 

AWS credentials are stored in a github secret.

### Further improvements 
1. Unit test cases 
2. Direct deployment to a perticular environment.
